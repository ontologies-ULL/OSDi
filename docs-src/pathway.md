When the risk of a disease progression ([`osdi:hasRiskCharacterization`]({{ config.extra.osdi }}#hasRiskCharacterization)) can be characterized as a deterministic or probabilistic value (a probability, proportion, rate...) it is straightforward to use a **Parameter** ([`osdi:Parameter`]({{ config.extra.osdi }}#Parameter)). A simple example on how to do so was depicted in the [parameters section](parameter.md#42-adding-uncertainty-to-parameters).

However, some times the risk is not only a number.
