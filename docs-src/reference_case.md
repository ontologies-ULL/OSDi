The tutorial uses as a reference case, the model developed to assess the **cost-effectiveness** of adding **Biotinidase Deficiency (BD) newborn screening (NBS)** to the national NBS program in Spain, as described by [Vallejo-Torres et al. (2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169436/). The analysis takes the perspective of the **Spanish National Health Service (NHS)**, using **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** as the measure of effectiveness. 

### 2.1. Biotinidase deficiency

* **Nature:** BD is an **autosomal recessive inherited disorder** where the enzyme biotinidase is defective, preventing the recycling of the vitamin biotin.
* **Forms:** Categorized as **profound BD** (<10% of normal activity) and **partial BD** (10%–30% of normal activity).
* **Consequences (Untreated):** Untreated profound BD can lead to severe neurologic and cutaneous symptoms including **seizures, hypotonia, skin rash, alopecia, cognitive deficits, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss**. Some consequences, like developmental delay, optic atrophy, and hearing loss, are generally **irreversible** once they occur.
* **Incidence (Galicia, Spain):** Combined BD incidence was estimated at **1 in 22,540** newborns, higher than the worldwide estimate.

### 2.2. Interventions Compared

1.  **Screening Strategy (Intervention):** Universal NBS for BD, including two initial screening tests, diagnostic confirmation, and lifelong **oral biotin supplementation** for confirmed cases. Cases detected early and treated are assumed to **remain asymptomatic**.
2.  **No Screening Strategy (Comparator):** Cases are detected only **after the onset of clinical symptoms** (clinical detection), leading to complications if not treated rapidly.
