# 🧠 Tutorial for the Ontology for the Simulation of Diseases (OSDi)

The **Ontology for the Simulation of Diseases (OSDi)** provides a structured framework for health technology assessment and simulation modeling. In this tutorial, valid for version 1.0 of the ontolgoy, we overview its main features and provide samples of use.

## General overview
**OSDi** 
_(Pending)_

Here we should explain the details on the structure and features

## Use cases
OSDi serves as an interoperability framework for a number of use cases: 
1. Extract information from a data source using an LLM
2. Automatically generate models (using [JaDES-HTA](https://github.com/JaDES-ULL/JaDES-HTA))
3. Infer new knowledge from the available information

## Ontology components
All the components of the ontology (classes, properties and common named individuals) are [documented online](https://w3id.org/ontologies-ULL/OSDi/1.0).
